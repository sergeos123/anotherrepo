Hi ;rep,

Looking at your JQL in the endpoint, you're using this syntax: 

jql=filter%3D36259&fields=*all&startAt=0&maxResults=1000

I am not familiar of such a usage of that API, as far as I am aware the syntax should be:

jql=filter=10000&fields=id,key'

where 10000 is the filter ID and fields are the fields you need to outpu (in your case it's *all)

Can you please try that syntax instead?

On another note, having checked the logs I can see that one of the main healtchecks in your JIRA instance has failed:

{panel}
Name: Lucene
Is healthy: false
Failure reason: The issue index is inconsistent with the database state. The last issue update recorded in the database was at (5/21/18 3:59 PM) but the last issue update recorded in the index was at (5/21/18 3:58 PM).
Severity: MAJOR
{panel}

This could actually affect REST API performance.
Can you please perform Re-indexing of JIRA as per the article below

Hi ;rep,

I think you've collected the HAR file incorrectly - I can not see any calls to https://flow-jira.ubs.net in it.

The purpose to capture a HAR file is to record the communication flow between the browser and JIRA as the issue is being reproduced so that we can see what exactly went wrong.

So here's what you need to do to recapture another HAR file

1) Open JIRA

2) Start the Developer's tools in Chrome, open Network Tab and make sure the recording is started
2.1) Check Disable Cache option to prevent caching of resources for this specific page.

3) Refresh the page to start capturing the traffic between the browser to the server.
(warning) Please capture a full page load so we can see the requests made prior to the problem we're analyzing.

4) Reproduce the issue in JIRA, i.e. refresh the page or perform the activity that leads to that "Communication breakdown" error.

5) In the Development tools -- verify that the activity has been recorded, i.e. you see requests and responses coming to and from JIRA

6) Save the output as HAR with content and attach to the case.


Regarding the logs -- it appears that you have not marked them as well - I am not able to see the "replication starts here" words anywhere in the logs except of the catalina snippet you've provided.

To mark the logs, please do as follows:

1) Navigate to JIRA Administration >> System >> Logging and profiling >> Mark Logs (<baseURL>/secure/admin/ViewLogging.jspa) - You will see "Optional Message" text box there -- that is where you need to enter "replication starts here" -- this will mark all the logs in JIRA -- i.e you don't have to do it manually

2) Mark the logs with "replication starts here"

3) Replicate the problem at the same time capturing the HAR file

4) Mark the logs again with "replication ends here"


Once collected, please attach both HAR file and new support zip to the case.

Hi ;rep,

My name is Sergey Oslopov and I am a Sydney (Australia) based support engineer assigned to assist you with this issue during my working hours between 08:00AM - 05:00PM AEST (Australian Eastern Standard Time zone, GMT +10) Monday to Friday. It's a pleasure to meet you :)

Thank you for the information you have provided so far and your patience while we are investigating this issue for you.

In regards to the issue, I would like to review the commmunication process between browser and JIRA.

Can you please perform the following:

1) [mark the logs|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/marking-jira-logs-for-troubleshooting-purposes-827334452.html] with "replication starts here" - This will allow us to pinpoint the activity in the logs

2) Capture a [HAR File|https://confluence.atlassian.com/kb/generating-har-files-and-analysing-web-requests-720420612.html] while reproducing the issue - please make sure the activity gets recorded in the .har file before sending the file to us

3) [mark the logs|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/marking-jira-logs-for-troubleshooting-purposes-827334452.html] with "replication starts here"

4) [Create a Support zip|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira064/getting-help-720412259.html#GettingHelp-CreatingaSupportZip] and attach to the case along with the .har file for further analysis.

Please address the above and we'll go from there

Regards,

Can you please [create a Support Zip file|https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/create-a-support-zip-790796819.html] and attach to the case?

Will be more than happy to help if you have any further issues or questions.
